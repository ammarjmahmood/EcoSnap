### Hosting on Vercel (Free Plan for Hobbyists)

#### Step 1: Host the Frontend on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - If you don’t have a repository yet, create one.
   - Add your frontend files (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, etc.) to the repository.

2. **Push Your Code:**
   - Push your frontend code to the repository using Git or GitHub Desktop.

3. **Set Up GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under "Source," select the branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`).
   - If needed, select the root folder or a subdirectory.

4. **Access Your Site:**
   - GitHub will provide a URL where your frontend is hosted.

#### Step 2: Host the Backend on Vercel

1. **Sign Up for Vercel:**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign up with your GitHub account.

2. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   - Install the Vercel CLI using npm:
     ```bash

3. **Initialize Vercel in Your Project:**
   - Navigate to your backend project directory (where `server.js` is located).
   - Run the following command to initialize Vercel:
     ```bash
     vercel
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to set up your project. Vercel will detect your Node.js project and configure it accordingly.

4. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - After setup, run:
     ```bash
     vercel deploy
     ```
   - Vercel will deploy your backend, and you’ll receive a URL for your live server.

5. **Set Environment Variables (If Needed):**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Environment Variables** and add any necessary variables (e.g., API keys).

6. **Update Frontend to Use Vercel Backend:**
   - Update the API endpoint in your `app.js` to the Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/analyze`).

7. **Deploy Updated Frontend:**
   - Push any changes to your frontend repository on GitHub.

#### Step 3: Access Your Application

- Your frontend is accessible via the GitHub Pages URL.
- Your backend is accessible via the Vercel URL, with the frontend pointing to this backend.
